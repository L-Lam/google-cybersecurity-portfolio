Hello! My name is Lawrence Lam, and this is my portfolio for the Google Cybersecurity course on Coursera. 
The link to the course is attached here: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity

I hope that my portfolio/repository will be able to keep you invested about my experience with cybersecurity as I followed the course. Please take a look at the files attached above regarding the projects I worked
on.

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
Lawrence
